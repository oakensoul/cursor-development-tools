## 🔄 How These Components Work Together

### **Template vs. Generated Files**

#### **Template Files** (Reusable Across Projects)
- **prompts/**: Reusable workflow automation commands
- **rules/**: AI behavior guidelines that work for any project
- **Base README files**: Documentation templates

#### **Generated Files** (Project-Specific)
- **workflow-rules.yml**: Created by `@init-workflow-rules` based on project analysis
- **ai-guidance.llms**: Generated by `@init-ai-guidance` from workflow rules
- **llms/*.llms**: Context files created by prompts in `prompts/context/`

### **Two-Tier Context System**

#### **Tier 1: Project Rules** (`workflow-rules.yml`)
- **Human-readable** YAML configuration generated for each project
- **Source of truth** for all project standards
- **Structured data** that drives AI behavior
- **Examples**: Git commit formats, learning timelines, quality standards

#### **Tier 2: AI Guidance** (`ai-guidance.llms`) 
- **Natural language** guidance for AI decision-making
- **Workflow intelligence** for complex scenarios
- **Edge case handling** and nuanced situations
- **Examples**: When to create hotfix vs regular branch, communication patterns

### **Auto-Generated Context** (`llms/` folder)
- **Regenerated from workflow-rules.yml** using prompts in `prompts/context/`
- **Project-specific knowledge** that changes as the project evolves
- **Different perspectives** for different audiences (new team members, stakeholders, etc.)
- **Examples**: "What tools will I use?", "Who are our stakeholders?", "How does the team work?"

### **Executable Workflows** (`prompts/` folder)
- **Command-style automation** (e.g., `@shipit`, `@commit`, `@hotfix`)
- **References both tiers** of context for intelligent behavior
- **End-to-end orchestration** of complex development tasks
- **Examples**: Auto-branching, conventional commits, PR generation

### **Development Rules** (`rules/` folder)
- **Cursor-specific behavior** for AI-assisted coding
- **Style and quality guidance** for content creation
- **Meta-rules** about how the AI system itself should work
- **Examples**: Writing tone, documentation standards, onboarding focus

## 🎯 File Purposes & When to Use

### **For Project Setup & Configuration**
- **Read**: `workflow-rules.yml` (understanding project standards)
- **Command**: `@init-workflow-rules` (new project setup)
- **Command**: `@update-workflow-rules` (evolving standards)

### **For AI Behavior & Decision Making**
- **Read**: `ai-guidance.llms` (understanding AI guidance)
- **Command**: `@init-ai-guidance` (new project AI setup)
- **Command**: `@update-ai-guidance` (refining AI behavior)

### **For Project Context & Knowledge**
- **Read**: `llms/*.llms` (understanding current project state)
- **Command**: `@update-context` (refresh all context files)
- **Auto**: Context updated during `@shipit`, `@pr`, `@commit` with `--update-context`

### **For Development Workflows**
- **Command**: `@shipit` (complete workflow: stage → branch → commit → push → PR)
- **Command**: `@commit` (intelligent commits with conventional format)
- **Command**: `@hotfix` (emergency branch creation)
- **Command**: `@pr` (auto-generated pull requests)

## 🔗 Reference Patterns

### **Context Files Referenced by Prompts**
Most prompts reference these context files for intelligent behavior:
```yaml
context_files: ["../workflow-rules.yml", "../ai-guidance.llms"]
```

### **Auto-Generated Files Reference Source**
Context generation prompts read from:
```yaml
context_files: ["../../workflow-rules.yml"] 
# → Generates llms/*.llms files
```

### **Rules Reference Context**
Development rules reference the broader context system:
```markdown
# References workflow-rules.yml and ai-guidance.llms for consistency
```

## 📋 Maintenance & Evolution

### **When to Update**
- **workflow-rules.yml**: When project standards, timelines, or processes change
- **ai-guidance.llms**: When AI behavior needs refinement or new patterns emerge
- **llms/*.llms**: Auto-updated, but can manually refresh with `@update-context`
- **prompts/**: When workflows need enhancement or new commands are needed
- **rules/**: When AI writing or development patterns need adjustment

### **Update Dependencies**
1. **workflow-rules.yml** changes → Run `@update-context` to refresh generated context
2. **ai-guidance.llms** changes → All git workflows automatically use new guidance
3. **New team insights** → Use `@update-ai-guidance` to capture learnings
4. **Process improvements** → Use `@update-workflow-rules` to codify new standards

### **Quality Assurance**
- **All prompts tested** before committing to ensure they work with current context
- **Context consistency** maintained between structured (YAML) and natural language files
- **Documentation kept current** with actual system behavior and capabilities

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Copy to your project
