# Project Overview Context Generator

Generate comprehensive `project-overview.llms` file from current `workflow-rules.yml` configuration.

## üéØ **Purpose**

Create LLM context that helps AI instantly understand:
- **What this project is** - type, purpose, scope, business value
- **Who uses it** - target audience, stakeholders, team members
- **How it's organized** - structure, content patterns, navigation
- **Why it matters** - business impact, team value, success metrics

## üìã **Content Structure**

### **Project Identity Section**
Extract from workflow-rules.yml:
- Project name, type (documentation/pipeline/api/etc.)
- Team name, company, primary purpose
- Target audience and user personas
- Business goals and success criteria

### **Repository Structure Section**
Analyze current directory structure and explain:
- Key directories and their purposes (/onboarding, /development, /architecture, etc.)
- Content organization philosophy (progressive complexity, audience-based, etc.)
- Navigation patterns and cross-references
- File naming conventions and content standards

### **Usage Patterns Section**
Describe how this repository is used:
- Daily workflow patterns (how team members interact)
- Update cycles (how often content changes, who updates it)
- Integration points (how this connects to other systems)
- Collaboration methods (how multiple people contribute)

### **Content Philosophy Section**
Explain the approach to documentation:
- Writing style and tone (professional helpful, action-oriented)
- Complexity approach (start simple, add depth progressively)
- Example preference (practical over theoretical)
- Audience assumptions (day-one new hire vs experienced)

### **Business Context Section**
Connect technical work to business value:
- How this repository supports business goals
- Stakeholder impact and dependency relationships
- Success metrics and quality indicators
- Team productivity and efficiency gains

## üß† **LLM Optimization Guidelines**

### **Write for AI Consumption**
- **Natural language** - avoid overly structured formats
- **Context-rich** - include background that helps AI understand nuance
- **Example-heavy** - concrete scenarios better than abstract principles
- **Decision-focused** - help AI make better suggestions and choices

### **Information Architecture**
- **Hierarchical** - general to specific information flow
- **Cross-referenced** - connect related concepts clearly
- **Actionable** - include guidance on how to use this information
- **Validated** - ensure accuracy with current project state

## üìÑ **Expected Output**

Generate a complete `project-overview.llms` file with this structure:

```markdown
# Project Overview: [Project Name]

## Auto-Generated Context
**Source**: workflow-rules.yml
**Generated**: [current timestamp]
**Purpose**: Comprehensive project context for LLM understanding

## Project Identity
[Project type, team, company, purpose extracted from workflow-rules.yml]

## Target Audience
[Who uses this repository and how they interact with it]

## Repository Organization
[Directory structure, content patterns, navigation philosophy]

## Content Standards
[Writing approach, quality standards, maintenance patterns]

```

## üîç **Quality Standards**

Ensure the generated content:
- [ ] **Accurately reflects** current workflow-rules.yml configuration
- [ ] **Serves the stated purpose** and target audience from workflow-rules.yml
- [ ] **Provides sufficient context** for AI to understand project purpose
- [ ] **Includes practical examples** from actual project scenarios
- [ ] **Connects technical work** to business value and impact
- [ ] **Uses consistent terminology** with other project documentation
- [ ] **Optimizes for LLM consumption** rather than human documentation

## üöÄ **Execution**

1. **Read workflow-rules.yml** - extract project configuration and context
2. **Analyze repository structure** - understand current organization
3. **Generate project-overview.llms** - following the specified structure
4. **Validate accuracy** - ensure content matches current project state
