# Business Context for New Engineers

## Context
This rule applies when creating or editing business context content that helps new team members understand the organization, stakeholders, and how their work creates business value during their first 30-90 days.

**Alignment with Project Context**: This rule supports our primary goal of "productive_contributor_in_30_days" by focusing on business knowledge that new engineers need for stakeholder interaction and impact understanding, as detailed in business-context.llms.

## New Engineer Business Learning

## Examples

### Good Business Context Integration
```markdown
## Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Calculation

### Business Context
Customer lifetime value is critical for the organization because:
- **Marketing Budget Allocation**: Determines how much we can spend to acquire customers
- **Product Development**: Guides feature prioritization for retention vs. acquisition
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Required for responsible gaming monitoring and reporting
- **Investor Reporting**: Key metric for demonstrating business sustainability

### Business Logic
We calculate CLV over a 12-month window because:
- Sports seasons create natural engagement cycles
- Regulatory requirements focus on annual gaming behavior
- Marketing campaigns are planned on seasonal/annual basis
- Financial reporting aligns with fiscal year planning

### Stakeholder Usage
- **Marketing Team**: Uses CLV for customer acquisition cost (CAC) optimization
- **Product Team**: Prioritizes features that increase CLV for key customer segments  
- **Finance Team**: Includes CLV projections in revenue forecasting models
- **Executive Team**: Tracks CLV trends as key business health indicator
```

### Good Stakeholder Communication Example
```markdown
## Marketing Team Data Needs

### Communication Preferences
- **Meeting Style**: Collaborative data review sessions with visual dashboards
- **Response Time**: 4-8 hours for campaign performance questions
- **Technical Depth**: Moderate - comfortable with filters and basic SQL concepts
- **Delivery Format**: Interactive dashboards with drill-down capability

### Key Business Questions
1. **Campaign Performance**: "Which acquisition channels deliver highest quality customers?"
2. **Attribution Analysis**: "How do different touchpoints contribute to conversion?"
3. **Audience Segmentation**: "What customer characteristics predict long-term value?"
4. **Competitive Analysis**: "How does our performance compare to industry benchmarks?"

### Success Metrics
- **Self-Service Adoption**: Marketing team answers 80% of questions independently
- **Decision Speed**: Data availability reduces campaign optimization cycle from weekly to daily
- **Business Impact**: Attribution insights improve marketing ROI by 15%
```

### Good Business Process Mapping
```markdown
## New User Registration → Data Pipeline

### Business Process
1. **User signs up** through web or mobile app
2. **Identity verification** including age and jurisdiction checks
3. **Account activation** with initial deposit (optional)
4. **Welcome series** email and in-app messaging
5. **First bet placement** or fantasy entry (conversion goal)

### Data Generation Points
- **Registration Event**: User demographics, acquisition source, device info
- **Verification Event**: Compliance checks, document validation, risk scoring
- **Deposit Event**: Payment method, transaction amount, bonus eligibility
- **Engagement Events**: Email opens, app sessions, feature usage
- **Conversion Event**: First bet details, amount, sport, outcome

### Business Impact
- **Regulatory Requirement**: Identity verification data required for licensing
- **Marketing Attribution**: Registration source determines campaign effectiveness measurement
- **Product Optimization**: Registration funnel analysis drives UX improvements
- **Risk Management**: Early behavioral patterns feed fraud detection models
