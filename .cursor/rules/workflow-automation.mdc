# Workflow Automation Context

## Project Context Files

This documentation project uses declarative AI commands with structured context:

### Context File Structure
- **`workflow-rules.yml`** - Structured workflow rules, commit conventions, branching strategy (source of truth)
- **`ai-guidance.llms`** - Natural language guidance for AI decision-making and workflow intelligence
- **`llms/*.llms`** - Auto-generated project context (project-overview, business-context, tech-stack, team-context)

### Git Workflow Integration
When users invoke git commands (like `@shipit`, `@commit`, `@hotfix`), these context files provide:
- Conventional commit formatting rules
- Branching strategy decisions (direct-to-main vs feature-branch)
- PR creation criteria and reviewer assignment
- Emergency hotfix procedures

### AI Behavior
- **Don't duplicate context**: These files are explicitly referenced by git prompts
- **Respect workflow decisions**: Follow the structured rules in workflow-rules.yml
- **Understand urgency levels**: Use hotfix criteria for emergency documentation fixes
- **Apply team standards**: Conventional commits, proper branch naming, appropriate review processes

The goal is **declarative git workflows** where users say "please commit these changes" rather than "how do I commit these changes."
