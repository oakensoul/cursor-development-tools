# Cursor AI Rules for New Engineer Onboarding

This directory contains MDC (Markdown with Context) files that provide focused, actionable guidance for AI-assisted development of team **onboarding and development** projects.

## üéØ Purpose

These rules enable AI tools (primarily Cursor AI) to:
- Create onboarding content that helps new engineers succeed in their first 30 days
- Follow established style guides optimized for learning progression
- Understand the specific context of team onboarding and development processes
- Provide relevant suggestions for onboarding content improvements
- Maintain the structure and quality of the learning-focused knowledge base

- **[content-structure.mdc](./content-structure.mdc)** - Information architecture organized by learning progression *(planned)*
- **[accessibility-standards.mdc](./accessibility-standards.mdc)** - Inclusive onboarding content *(planned)*

### Onboarding-Specific Rules
- **[onboarding-content.mdc](./onboarding-content.mdc)** - Guidelines for new engineer onboarding content
- **[technical-documentation.mdc](./technical-documentation.mdc)** - Standards for technical content with learning progression
- **[business-context.mdc](./business-context.mdc)** - Business knowledge focused on new engineer needs

### Quality Assurance

- Reviewing content for new engineer effectiveness
- Suggesting onboarding workflow improvements

### Manual Reference
Team members can reference these rules when:
- Writing new onboarding content
- Reviewing onboarding-related pull requests
- Establishing new onboarding standards
- Improving the new engineer experience

## üìã Rule Format

Each MDC file follows this structure:
```markdown
---
targeting: [file patterns or contexts]
priority: [high|medium|low]
scope: [specific area of application]
---

# Rule Title

## Context
[When this rule applies]

## Guidelines
[Specific actionable guidance]

## Examples
[Good and bad examples]

## Cross-References
[Related rules and documentation]
```

## üîß Maintenance

### Review Schedule
- **Monthly**: Review rule effectiveness and update based on usage
- **Quarterly**: Comprehensive review and optimization
- **As-needed**: Updates based on team feedback and new requirements

### Update Process
1. Identify need for new rule or update to existing rule
2. Create or modify MDC file with clear targeting and guidelines
